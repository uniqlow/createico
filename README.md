# createico

createico is a very simple ICO creation tool.

## Background

Coming from Unix and not being a very experienced Windows developer,
I was surprised that apparently there is not already such a tool included
with either Windows itself, or at least in the Windows SDK
 besides VisualStudio.

I whipped this up in about 15 minutes just so that I could build a Windows
executable with a real icon automatically through CMake.

It's probably very buggy unfortunately, but it does what I need.
